# hello-world
first repository
I'm Ollie. I'm new to programming and I am learning the basics.
I would like to aquire enough knowledge to be able to make an income from programming.
I am interested in learning about game development, AI and data science.
I enjoy building computers and making with electronics so learning to code seems to be the next logical step.
At present I am learning self taught.
